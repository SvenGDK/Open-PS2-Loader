rev822 - Removed locking semaphore for game list, GUI OPs will now be cleared before the menu is cleared prior to game list updating (so that old commands will not be executed) and added checks for file-open problems under USB support. - Fri Aug 21 18:52:47 2015 +0800
rev821 - Updated to support the new PS2SDK changes (SIF CMD buffer set, USBHDFSDV SIF CMD ID changed to 0), USBHDFSD IOCTL codes consolidated into usb-ioctl.h, standardized which "prefix" buffer to use within usbsupport.c (was unable to access game files when a prefix is set, due to the path getting incorrectly generated), removed cdrom_lseek64 as it is not implemented in the SONY CDVDMAN, changed cdrom_dclose to become cdrom_close since close() and dclose() are the same here and SONY does it that way too, simplified cdrom_lseek to be more tolerant to errors like the SONY original, adjusted CBT to apply to reading operations as well, adjusted CBT to be 5000us, adjusted speed limit for Accurate Reads to 2800KB/s (timed to the 36.864MHz IOP clock). - Sat Aug 15 18:03:17 2015 +0800

rev815 - Update LNG files credits and dates for OPL r811. - Sun Aug 02 20:14:16 2015 -0700
rev814 - Re-added 'VGA 640x480i @60Hz' again GSM vmode for better game compatibility (avoid BSOD/freezing/no signal on certain games and VGA monitors) - Sat Aug 01 16:37:38 2015 -0700
rev813 - Merged the CallBack Timer setting into Accurate Reads compat mode (applies to everything other than reads), new compat mode (High module storage @ 0x01C00000), EE core linkfile adjusted to have the stack before _end for better manageability, EE core will now always reset stack pointer to _end, and fixed blockSize within fat.c overflowing (resulted in extremely poor performance). - Mon Aug 03 22:40:45 2015 -0400
rev812 - Fixed VMC size parameter for USB support, simplified LSN calculation for the first phase of cdrom_read() since integer division will truncate anyway, changed stray memcpy() call in fat.c to mips_memcpy(), fixed (updated) the delete and rename functions within supportbase, and fixed updating of the game list under USB mode after an item has been deleted/renamed. - Mon Aug 03 03:31:02 2015 +0800

rev808 - added a new word to LNG SRC files so it can be used to replace the word SETTINGS in the footer of main page so it can abbreviated in the LNG files without affecting the same full word in other areas; updated LNG files to include new changes in recent commits; French LNG updated 100% translated. - Tue Jul 28 09:13:12 2015 -0700
rev807 - Imported fixes for SMAP (wrong watermark value) and IOMAN (incorrect declaration for lseek) stuff, fixed GSM extension's "ok" button, added patch entry for SRW IMPACT LE, removed NBNS's Rules.make file in favour of the common one, and adjusted in-game FAT driver's parameters and strategy to improve seeking performance. - Tue Jul 28 09:08:30 2015 -0700
rev806 - Merged in Jay-Jay/open-ps2-loader (pull request #22) - Sun Aug 02 03:38:49 2015 +0800
rev805 - Updating some LNG files. - Tue Jul 28 20:11:29 2015 +0800
rev804 - Added missing files from previous commit, removed leftover SMB DMA address definition (disused since long ago) and removed leftover code that updated ReadPos (is now updated by CDVDMAN itself, not by the individual drivers). - Mon Jul 27 01:46:03 2015 -0700
rev803 - Added a small FAT driver to in-game USB support. USB support no longer needs total disc image defragmentation and all sector sizes should be supported. - Tue Jul 28 15:39:25 2015 +0800
rev802 - Changed game list-locking mechanism to use a semaphore, game list will now be locked when updated and drawn (mutually exclusive operations), deferred GUI operations will be cleared when the GUI is to be suspended (otherwise a crash might result because the requests would be for the previous GUI instance), fixed ELFLDR (wrong compile-time flags, hence IOP reset missing) by removing the RESET_IOP option, re-ordered code that checks for outstanding deferred GUI operations (guiHandleDeferredOps) to prevent potential crash if the linked-list is modified as it waits for the list to be unlocked (not done here, but IF), lowered the priority of the running thread to 90 in ioBlockOps() as it was starving lower-priority (NETMAN) threads, and removed redundant calls to SifInitRpc() in sysExecElf and sysLaunchLoaderElf. - Tue Jul 28 14:21:03 2015 +0800
rev801 - Refactored config reading system to allow reading of config file from RAM (for future use), fixed IOMAN crashing due to the request list being set to NULL as it waits for the process sema to be released, fixed OPL getting stuck if HDLDump server could not be started, refactored directory-creation system to be unified and without the need for a redundant check, changed GSM controls to become read-only if GSM is disabled, completed moving the GSM stuff into pggsm.h, added missing "childproof" target into Makefile, consolidated the different IO handler types into opl.h, updated to build with the latest PS2SDK revision, added support for DNS (for future use and manual static setting will not be saved!), added a setting into opl.h that determiens whether the OPL source is a development version, blocking I/O operations in IOMAN will no longer pause I/O execution (oustanding I/O operations will be completed), the I/O request sema will be locked when the number of I/O requests are counted, error messages will now be cleared when HDLDump server is started, failures to start the HDLDump server will be stated, CFG folder will now be "CFG-DEV" instead for development builds, changed config-handling code to use the limits from config.h for key and value management, and changed network initialization to prevent deadlocks that occur during simultaneous initialization of HDLDump and SMB support. - Mon Jul 27 05:12:21 2015 +0800
rev800 - Fixed SMB auto-refresh (CD, DVD and USBExtreme lists checked one-by-one) and refactored code in CDVDMAN and MCEMU for better coherency (USB, SMB and HDD-split up into individual files, for as much as possible). - Sun Jul 26 03:40:05 2015 +0800
rev799 - BUGFIX: Replaced all calls (and related macros) to the FILEIO RPC service with FILEXIO. OPL is intermittently unstable when listing games, as the rom0:FILEIO module does not suspend interrupts before the DMA transfers for the dread() and getstat() functions (SONY BUGBUG!!). - Sun Jul 12 20:40:11 2015 +0800
rev798 - Fixes: Added check for streaming status into CDVDMAN streaming system (for games that read after starting streaming), fixed broken CDVDMAN debug build, changed ambiguous debug strings in CDVDMAN, fixed length checking of ISO filenames and improved on error-handling code in supportbase.c. - Sat Jul 11 03:25:55 2015 +0800
rev797 - Fixed and enhanced streaming support: - Sat Jul 11 03:17:13 2015 +0800
rev796 - Consolidated error codes, added error codes for HDD mode, sync'ed with updates to HDD and PFS from PS2SDK, added workaround for clone/compatible network adaptors and corrected UV coordinates for texture-drawing. - Sun Jun 28 18:18:52 2015 +0800
rev795 - Fixed NBNS support (unable to resolve NB names after first attempt), revised timeout clock value and adjusted code to prevent some other race-conditions from occuring, adjusted SMB support initialization code to always retry until the link mode can be set successfully, changed link mode setting and DHCP completion-checking intervals to 1 second (reduce strain on IOP), link mode will now be set once at initialization before the TCP/IP stack is initialized (avoid double-initializing the SMAP). Updated to support the new PS2SDK revision. - Sat Jun 20 20:06:02 2015 +0800
rev794 - Fixed SMB intialization when built within VMC support, by moving the SMB initialization function into the "oplsmb" export table. - Tue Jun 16 21:50:14 2015 +0800
rev793 - Moved SMB authentication code into a SMBINIT IOP module, so that SMB code can be modular and won't be part of the EE core itself. Fixed support for the USBLD format under SMB mode, renamed mode 5 to "Emulate DVD-DL", fixed filesystem selection within cdvdman_findfile() for mode 5, fixed NBNS support to check against the transaction ID as specified in the RFCs, changed the EE-side libnbns library into a normal C file for simplicity, and lowered the module storage region so that the occupied region will be as low as possible since SMB authentication code is now in an IOP module. - Sat May 30 13:02:35 2015 +0800
