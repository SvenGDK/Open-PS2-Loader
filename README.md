  <summary> <b> How to use the NBD server </b> </summary>
<p>

- To connect to the NBD server you will first need an NBD client and driver on your PC.
- The Ceph MSI installer bundles a signed version of the WNBD driver. </br> It can be downloaded from here: https://cloudbase.it/ceph-for-windows/
- Install the client and reboot.
- Open CMD as administrator and run: </br> ```wnbd-client.exe map hdd1 SERVER_IP``` <- Shown in OPL when NBD server started.
- You can now install games with hdl_dump like: </br> ```hdl_dump inject_dvd hdd1: "GAME_TITLE" "ISO_FILE" "BLUS_123.45" *u4```
- Unfortunately, this process can take up to 1-2 hours depending on game size.
- If you want to disconnect, open CMD as administrator and run: </br> ```wnbd-client.exe unmap hdd1```
