## Introduction

Open PS2 Loader (OPL) is a 100% Open source game and application loader for
the PS2 and PS3 units. It supports three categories of devices: USB mass
storage devices, SMB shares and the PlayStation 2 HDD unit. USB devices and
SMB shares support USBExtreme and \*.ISO formats while PS2 HDD supports HDLoader
format, all devices also support ZSO format (compressed ISO). It's now the most compatible homebrew loader.

OPL developed continuously - anyone can contribute improvements to
the project due to its open-source nature.

  <summary> <b> How to use </b> </summary>
<p>

OPL uses the following directory tree structure across HDD, SMB, and
USB modes:

| Folder | Description                                          | Modes       |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `CD`   | for games on CD media - i.e. blue-bottom discs       | USB and SMB |
| `DVD`  | for DVD5 and DVD9 images if using the NTFS file system on USB or SMB; DVD9 images must be split and placed into the device root if using the FAT32 file system on USB or SMB | USB and SMB |
| `VMC`  | for Virtual Memory Card images - from 8MB up to 64MB | all         |
| `CFG`  | for saving per-game configuration files              | all         |
| `ART`  | for game art images                                  | all         |
| `THM`  | for themes support                                   | all         |
| `LNG`  | for translation support                              | all         |
| `CHT`  | for cheats files                                     | all         |

OPL will automatically create the above directory structure the first time you launch it and enable your favorite device.

For HDD users, OPL will read `hdd0:__common/OPL/conf_hdd.cfg` for the config entry "hdd_partition" to use as your OPL partition.
If not found a config file, a 128Mb `+OPL` partition will be created. You can edit the config if you wish to use/create a different partition.
All partitions created by OPL will be 128Mb (it is not recommended to enlarge partitions as it will break LBAs, instead remove and recreate manually with uLaunchELF at a larger size if needed).

<details>
  <summary> <b> USB </b> </summary>
<p>

Game files on USB must be perfectly defragmented either file by file or
by whole drive, and Dual Layer DVD9 images must be split to avoid the 4GB
limitations of the FAT32 file system. We do not recommend using any programs.
The best way for defragmenting - copy all files to pc, format USB, copy all files back.
Repeat it once you faced defragmenting problem again.

You also need a PC program to convert or split games into USB Advance/Extreme
format, such as USBUtil 2.0.

</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <b> SMB </b> </summary>
<p>

For loading games by SMB protocol, you need to share a folder (ex: PS2SMB)
on the host machine or NAS device and make sure that it has full read and
write permissions. USB Advance/Extreme format is optional - \*.ISO images
are supported using the folder structure above with the bonus that
DVD9 images don't have to be split if your SMB device uses the NTFS or
EXT3/4 file system.

</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <b> HDD </b> </summary>
<p>

For PS2, 48-bit LBA internal HDDs up to 2TB are supported. HDD should be
formatted with the APA partition scheme. OPL will create the `+OPL` partition on the HDD.
To avoid this, you can create a text file at the location `hdd0:__common:pfs:OPL/conf_hdd.txt`
that contains the preferred partition name (for example `__common`).

  <summary> <b> NBD Server </b> </summary>
<p>

A [NBD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_block_device) server replaced HDL server.
NBD is [formally documented](https://github.com/NetworkBlockDevice/nbd/blob/master/doc/proto.md)
and developed as a collaborative open standard.
The current implementation of the server is based on [lwNBD](https://github.com/bignaux/lwNBD),
go there to contribute.
The main advantage of using NBD is that the client will simulate a similar
interface to the OS as if the device was plugged directly into your machine.
All your favorite software that worked with the device directly connected to your
machine, will work with the device accessible through the network.

Currently, only export for HDD is supported by the server.
You can use hdl-dump, pfs-shell, or even directly edit disk in some hex editor.
Example, how to install HDL game to the HDD:
Connect with your choosen client, then `hdl_dump inject_dvd ps2/nbd "Test Game" ./TEST.ISO`
and when you're done, disconnect the client.

So you need a NBD client.
Here we list some known compatible clients and how to use them.

### nbd-client

Supported: Linux, [Windows with WSL and custom kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5968)

nbd-client requires nbd kernel support. If it isn't loaded,
`sudo modprobe nbd` will do.

list available export:

```sh
nbd-client -l 192.168.1.45
```

connect:

```sh
nbd-client 192.168.1.45 /dev/nbd1
```

disconnect:

```sh
nbd-client -d /dev/nbd1
```

You'll generally need sudo to run this commands in root or
add your user to the right group usually "disk".

### nbdfuse

Supported: Linux, Windows with WSL2

list available export:

```sh
nbdinfo --list nbd://192.168.1.45
```

connect:

```sh
mkdir ps2
nbdfuse ps2/ nbd://192.168.1.45 &
```

disconnect:

```sh
umount ps2
```

### wnbd

Supported: Windows

[WNBD client](https://cloudbase.it/ceph-for-windows/).
Install, reboot, open elevated (with Administrator rights) [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/starting-windows-powershell?view=powershell-7.1#how-to-start-windows-powershell-on-earlier-versions-of-windows)

connect:

```sh
wnbd-client.exe map hdd0 192.168.1.22
```

disconnect:

```sh
wnbd-client.exe unmap hdd0
```

### Mac OS

Not supported.

<details>
  <summary> <b> ZSO Format </b> </summary>
<p>

As of version 1.2.0, compressed ISO files in ZSO format is supported by OPL.

To handle ZSO files, a python script (ziso.py) is included in the pc folder of this repository.
It requires Python 3 and the LZ4 library:
  
  ```sh
pip install lz4
```
  
To compress an ISO file to ZSO:
  
  ```sh
python ziso.py -c 2 "input.iso" "output.zso"
```
  
To decompress a ZSO back to the original ISO:
  
```sh
python ziso.py -c 0 "input.zso" "output.iso"
```
  
You can copy ZSO files to the same folder as your ISOs and they will be detected by OPL.
To install onto internal HDD, you can use the latest version of HDL-Dump.

<details>
  <summary> <b> PS3 BC </b> </summary>
<p>

Currently, supported only [PS3 Backward Compatible](https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/PS2_Compatibility#PS2-Compatibility) (BC) versions. So only [COK-001](https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/COK-00x#COK-001) and [COK-002/COK-002W](https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/COK-00x#COK-002) boards are supported. USB, SMB, HDD modes are supported.

To run OPL, you need an entry point for running PS2 titles. You can use everything (Swapmagic PS2, for example), but custom firmware with the latest Cobra is preferred. Note: only CFW supports HDD mode.
