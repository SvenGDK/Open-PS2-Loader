# This file is a template for translators. This file's encoding must be UTF8.                     #
#                                                                                                 #
# Translate every line, keeping the same order. Don't add empty lines.                            #
# Any missing lines will be substituted with the English defaults from lang.c.                    #
#                                                                                                 #
# Important: if your language require some custom glyphs, you should provide a corresponding      #
# TTF/OTF font file too. By default, OPL only comes with the "basic Latin" font built-in.         #
#                                                                                                 #
# Once the translation is complete, you can submit it to the development team.                    #
#                                                                                                 #
# To use your custom language with OPL, simply copy your file into your mc?:/OPL or LNG folder.   #
# (File must start with the "lang_" prefix and have the ".lng" extension)                         #
#                                                                                                 #
# Finally, don't put too many comments in your file, it will waste space and increases loading    #
# time. One single comment line on top (e.g. "name <yourmail@address.com>") should be enough.     #
#                                                                                                 #
# Thanks for your work.                                                                           #
#                                                                                                 #
